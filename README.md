# About Me
Cybersecurity Student | Penetration Tester | Reverse Engineer]
Collin College Bachelors of Applied Technology in Cybersecurity

I am a cybersecurity bachelor-level graduate and this is my portfolio!
My personal interests lie in computer science and cybersecurity. The world is changing and it is now vital to understand the foundations to this change; AI and quantum computing.

Personal Opinions & Views

Programming Paradigms:
- Hesitant about Rust's adoption in Linux due to its complexity and potential performance trade-offs.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is often over-implemented, causing unnecessary bloat in systems like firmware or kernels. Procedural programming may improve efficiency for such use cases.
- Open-minded to all paradigms but advocate for practicality and simplicity.

Cybersecurity & Technology:

- Cybersecurity stands at a crossroads with AI and quantum computing as the new frontiers.
- Prediction: Governments will introduce severe restrictions on AI/quantum due to risks of malicious use or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
- Cloud services are a boon against traditional hacking
- Zero Trust Architecture is essential for Blue Teams:
  - Network segmentation + Role-Based Access Controls prevent unauthorized enumeration and escalation.
- Both red and blue teams must leverage AI. Be aware that threat actors are already using it.

Current Goals:

Focus on penetration testing, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cybersecurity tool development.
Explore quantum computing, machine learning, and post-quantum cryptography (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber).
